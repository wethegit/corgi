# Installation

For versioning reasons, it's recommended to use `npx` to pull and install the executable _locally_, on demand. If this is not your cup of tea, you can also install the `corgi` command globally.

```bash title="example corgi command with npx"
npx @corgi/cli component ToggleButton
```

Or

```bash title="Installation and usage via a global corgi command"
npm install -g @corgi/cli

# usage:
corgi component ToggleButton
```

Read on to learn about the specific `corgi` commands for creating new projects, pages, and components.
