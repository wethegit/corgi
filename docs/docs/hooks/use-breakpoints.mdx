# `useBreakpoints`

Location: `/src/hooks/use-breakpoints.js`

The `useBreakpoints` hook provides us with the current breakpoint. This value is automatically updated on resize.

## Return value

`useBreakpoints` returns an object containing a handful of helpful values for working with media queries (breakpoints) and conditional rendering, among other uses. The mapping of breakpoints is as follows (see table below for details):

```
1: small
2: medium
3: large
4: xlarge
5: xxlarge
```

| Value           | Type     | Description                                          |
| --------------  | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| BREAKPOINTS     | Object   | Mapping of breakpoint keys to their string values.   |
| breakpointIndex | Number   | An integer representation of the current breakpoint. |
| breakpointName  | String   | A string representation of the current breakpoint.   |
| mediumUp        | Boolean  | Result of the expression `breakpontIndex > 1`        |
| mediumDown      | Boolean  | Result of the expression `breakpontIndex < 3`        |
| largeUp         | Boolean  | Result of the expression `breakpontIndex > 2`        |
| xlargeUp        | Boolean  | Result of the expression `breakpontIndex > 3`        |

## Usage

```jsx
import { useBreakpoints } from "@local/hooks";

import MyMobileDeviceComponent from "../somewhere"
import WildlyDifferentDesktopComponent from "../somewhere"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { breakpointIndex, breakpointName, BREAKPOINTS } = useBreakpoints()

  console.log(breakpointName === BREAKPOINTS.small) // => logs true or false

  return breakpointIndex < 3 ? (
    <MyMobileDeviceComponent />
  ) : (
    <WildlyDifferentDesktopComponent />
  )
};
```
