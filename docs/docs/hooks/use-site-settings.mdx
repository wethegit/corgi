# `useSiteState`

Location: `/src/hooks/use-site-state.js`

The `useSiteState` hook provides a generic, global settings context for the site. Many of its properties and methods returned by default are necessary for various pieces of corgi page management logic. However, it's an extremely open-ended hook, so in addition to these properties and methods, you are encouraged to add your own global/site-wide state if needed.

:::danger Overuse of React Context
Any change of state within a Context Provider _will_ cause a re-render of all of its children. Only use this hook if you're absolutely sure that the state needs to managed at the app-level.

`useSiteState()`

## Return value

`useSiteState` returns an object containing the following properties:

| Property        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| modalOpen       | Boolean  | A flag for the _full scope_ of your site, which tells all child components when a Modal window is open. Note that corgi does not provide a modal component out of the box.                                                                        |
| setModalOpen    | Function | An updater function for the `modalOpen` state. It can be useful to call this function along with your modal open/close implementation, passing in whatever the "open" state is.                                                                   |
| background      | String   | A generic value that can be used to set an element's background from much deeper in the DOM.                                                                                                                                                      |
| setBackground   | Function | An updater function for the `background` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| pageHistory     | Array    | A reverse-chronological list of page directory names that have been visited, for use under the hood in the `useLocale` hook.                                                                                                                      |
| addPage         | Function | Adds the provided value to the beginning of the `pageHistory` array.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| transitionState | String   | The current Page Transition state. One of: `"ready"`, `"out"`, `"in"`, or `"complete"`.                                                                                                                                                           |
| transitionEvent | Function | Dispatches a Page Transition event, based on the provided value. One of: `"onExit"`, `"onExiting"`, `"onEntering"`, `"onEntered"`. See [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) for more information on this. |
| version         | String   | The app version, as specified in `package.json`.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Usage

The following is just an example of the many things you _could_ do with this hook — it's really quite open-ended. Here we're setting a property on the site state context, called `background`, from within a component `<MyComponent>`. In the next code block, we're using that `background` value to manipulate a CSS custom property on the `<div id="main-content">` element.

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react"
import useSiteState from "@local/hooks/use-site-state";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { setBackground } = useSiteState();

  useEffect(() => {
    // sets the background property of the siteState to "red", on mount.
    setBackground("red")
  }, [])

  ...
};
```

```jsx title=/src/containers/page.js
import useSiteState from "@local/hooks/use-site-state";

const Page = ({ children, className, version }) => {
  const { background } = useSiteState();

  return (
    <div
      id="main-content"
      className={styles.mainContent}
      style={{ "--bg": background }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

The CSS module for the `<Page>` component above might then look something like:

```scss title=/src/containers/page.module.scss
.mainContent {
  background: var(--bg);
}
```
