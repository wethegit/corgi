# The `<Picture>` component

**Location:** `/src/components/common/picture/picture.jsx`

:::tip Image optimization
Please read the [image optimization docs](./image-optimization) before using the `<Picture>` component!
:::

corgi's built-in `<Picture>` component allows you to easily use the generated and optimized images from its [image optimization](./image-optimization) step. This component renders a standard [HTML `<picture>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture); with fallback formats, 1x and 2x srcset support, and breakpoint-specific images.

## Basic usage

Given the source file location of `/src/images/defined/logos/my-company-logo-2x.png`, we can use the component as shown below.

There are two things to take note of here:

- The `src` attribute does _not_ expect the `-2x` suffix in the filename.
- corgi recognizes that the source image is a PNG, and thus generates a WEBP version as well.

```jsx title="<Picture> component usage"
import { Picture } from "@local/components/common";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Picture
    src="logos/my-company-logo.png"
    alt="Description of the company logo."
  />
);
```

```html title="Rendered DOM markup"
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="
      /_images/logos/my-company-logo.webp    1x,
      /_images/logos/my-company-logo-2x.webp 2x
    "
    type="image/webp"
  />
  <source
    srcset="
      /_images/logos/my-company-logo.png    1x,
      /_images/logos/my-company-logo-2x.png 2x
    "
    type="image/png"
  />
  <img
    class=""
    alt="Description of the company logo."
    src="/_images/logos/my-company-logo.png"
  />
</picture>
```

## Images for different breakpoints

Providing your source files' names with specific _breakpoint_ suffixes will generate and optimize all the necessary breakpoint-specific versions of your image. The best part? You do not have to change anything about how you use the component—it's all automatic, based on the filenames. The breakpoint suffixes are as follows, and match those of corgi's pre-defined CSS breakpoints:

```txt title="Available breakpoint suffixes"
medium-up
large-up
xlarge-up
xxlarge-up
```

```txt title="File tree with breakpoint-specific images"
src/
└── images/
    └── defined/
        └── logos/
            ├── my-company-logo-2x.png
            ├── my-company-logo-medium-up-2x.png
            └── my-company-logo-large-up-2x.png
```

```html title="Rendered DOM markup"

  <source

      /_images/logos/my-company-logo-2x.webp 2x

    type="image/webp"
    width="248"
    height="128"
  />
  <source
    srcset="
      /_images/logos/my-company-logo.png    1x,
      /_images/logos/my-company-logo-2x.png 2x
    "
    type="image/png"
    width="248"
    height="128"
  />
  <img
    class=""
    alt="Description of the company logo."
    src="/_images/logos/my-company-logo.png"
  />
</picture>
```

As you can see, this is component is invaluable for working with images!
