# Locale data

Static site data for each locale is grouped into two general categories: the "global" data and the "page" data. Global data refers to site-wide content—things like navigation menus, footers, and so on—while page data refers to page-specific content—things like a homepage header, or a biography for an "about" page.

All static locale data lives within the `/src/locales/` directory, and is grouped into these two categories. You can treat the `globals` directory as a reserved directory name, as all global (site-wide) data is compiled from within it. All other directories here, however, are page-level data directories which should match each page's filename as it exists in the `/src/pages/` directory.

Within both `/src/locales/globals/` and `/src/locales/<page-name>/`, should live YAML files containing the actual locale data. Each YAML file's name should be the locale string as specified in the [locale config](./configuration#locales), with a `.yml` extension, except for the `index.yml` file, which is a special case for each directory (more on that below).

Here is an example file tree, containing global data as well as data for two pages—all containing content for three locales:

```
.
└── src/
    └── locales/
        ├── globals/
        │   ├── en.yml
        │   ├── es.yml
        │   ├── fr.yml
        │   └── index.yml
        ├── home/
        │   ├── en.yml
        │   ├── es.yml
        │   ├── fr.yml
        │   └── index.yml
        └── features/
            ├── en.yml
            ├── es.yml
            └── fr.yml
```

## Locale data compilation

Under the hood, all of these files get compiled into two objects—`globals` and `page`—and are then passed to each page as props. This process is done via Next JS' `getStaticProps` convention. The [`useLocale` hook](./use-locale-hook) is a convenient way to work with this data from _any_ functional React component in your project.

## `globals` example

An example `globals` YAML file for the `"en"` locale:

```yml title=/src/locales/globals/en.yml
meta:
  title: My Cool Web App
  description: The site-wide meta description.
  og_alt: Description of the og image.

nav:
  label: Main site navigation
  items:
    - id: home
      label: Home
    - id: features
      label: Product Features
    - id: contact
      label: Get in touch

footer: © Company Name.
```

As mentioned, that data gets compiled into a page-level prop called `globals`, for the current page and locale. Here's an example that uses that data (via [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook)) from within an imaginary `<Navigation />` component:

```jsx title=/src/components/navigation/navigation.jsx
import { useLocale } from "@local/hooks"

const Navigation = () => {
  const { globals } = useLocale()

  return (
    <nav aria-labelledby="nav-label">
      <span id="nav-label" className="visually-hidden">{globals.nav.label}</span>
      <ul>
        {globals.nav.items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.label}</li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </nav>
  )
}

export default Navigation
```

## `page` example

An example "Product Features" page YAML file for the `"en"` locale:

```yml title=/src/locales/features/en.yml
meta:
  title: Product Features
  description: Our product is pretty cool. It does cool things.

features:
  - id: 897213
    image: path-to-some-image.jpg
    image_alt: Description of image goes here.
    description: Laborum sint ut mollit proident quis do proident ex laboris sint nisi.
  - id: 216357
    image: path-to-some-other-image.jpg
    image_alt: Description of image goes here.
    description: Consequat ea fugiat irure do magna fugiat ex minim aute proident ullamco.
  - id: 187236
    image: path-to-yet-another-image.jpg
    image_alt: Description of image goes here.
    description: Magna in laborum aliquip exercitation est est est.
```

This data gets compiled into a page-level prop called `page`, for the current page and locale. Here's an example that uses that data (via [`useLocale`](./use-locale-hook)) from within an imaginary `<FeatureList>` component:

```jsx title=/src/components/feature-list.jsx
import { useLocale } from "@local/hooks";

const FeatureList = ({}) => {
  const { page } = useLocale();

  return (
    <ul>
      {page.features.map((feature) => (
        <li key={feature.id}>
          <img src={feature.image} alt={featue.image_alt} />
          <span>{feature.description}</span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default FeatureList;
```

## `index.yml` example

Each directory within `/src/locales/` can contain an `index.yml`. If inside `global/` its data will be available as part of the `globals` scope mentioned above, otherwise it will be part of the `page` scope.

If inside a page locale directory, the data will be available for all locales, but those can still overwrite that data.

Let's say you have a list of downlodable PDFs that you want to display on the footer of your site. These PDFs are in english for all locales except for `fr`. You can define the list in the `index.yml` file and then overwrite it for the `fr` locale instead of having to define it for each locale.

```yml title=/src/locales/globals/index.yml
downloads:
  - path-to-pdf-1.pdf
  - path-to-pdf-2.pdf
  - path-to-pdf-3.pdf
```

```yml title=/src/locales/globals/fr.yml
downloads:
  - fr/path-to-pdf-1.pdf
  - fr/path-to-pdf-2.pdf
  - fr/path-to-pdf-3.pdf
```

The data is then merged and is available in the `globals` scope.

```jsx title=/src/components/footer.jsx
import { useLocale } from "@local/hooks";

const Footer = ({}) => {
  const { globals: { downloads } } = useLocale();

  return (
    <ul>
      {downloads.map((path, i) => (
        <li key={i}>
          <a href={path} download><Icon id="download" /></a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default Footer;
```
