# Directory Structure

## Dynamic locale-based routing

Next.js 12 uses page-based routing, meaning the structure of your `/src/pages/` directory will directly determine the routes of your project. In corgi, all pages must live one step deeper: within the `/src/pages/[locale]/` directory.

The `[locale]` directory acts as a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), which—when compiled—results in the appropriate locale string being slotted into the URL.

Here is an example file tree for the pages directory in a corgi project. We'll cover some of the other files shortly; let's only concern ourselves with the `[locale]` directory for now:

```
.
└── src/
    └── pages/
        ├── [locale]/
        │   ├── index.js
        │   ├── about/
        │   │   └── index.js
        │   └── contact/
        │       └── index.js
        ├── _app.js
        ├── _document.js
        ├── 404.js
        ├── 500.js
        └── index.js
```

The directory structure above will result in the following routes, assuming [locales](../category/localization) are defined for "en", "es", and "fr":

```js title="Page routes"
/
/es
/fr

/en/about
/es/about
/fr/about

/en/contact
/es/contact
/fr/contact
```

:::info Default locale homepage URL
Note that the root (homepage) of the default locale's URL does _not_ contain the locale string. This is an opinion enforced by corgi, in an effort to have simpler URLs for the primary locele's landing page experience.

In other words, corgi makes it so that you don't have to share your website as `myproject.com/en` if your default locale is `"en"`. Rather, you can just share `myproject.com`

## Other files in the `pages` directory

### `/src/pages/index.js`

This is the root/homepage component, for the **default** locale only. It ensures that you can navigate to `/` on your project, and see the default locale's content.

:::caution Homepage content
All homepage _content_ must be edited in the `/src/components/home-page-contents` component, becuase this particular index page is not the only place the homepage content needs to live. A homepage index file must also live in the dynamic [locale] path (for localized pages, of course!) — thus the abstracted component for the homepage. More on this in the [page component](./page-components#homepage-specifics) section.

### `_app_.js`, `_document.js`

These are no different than the typical custom Next.js 12 setup, and handle things like global context providers, the HTML `<head>` element, `<body>` tag, and so on. More info in the Next docs, for [`_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) and [`_document.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document).

### `404.js`, `500.js`

These are resource-not-found and server-error files, which are required for Next.js builds. Since corgi generates a static site, these files are not actually _used_ in a deployment build, but since Next.js requires them, we must keep them here.
