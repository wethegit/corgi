# Page components

There are some specific requirements and "boilerplate" for creating a page component in Corgi. While we suggest using the Corgi CLI to [create page components]((../corgi-cli/commands/page)), this section will provide the information you need to gain a deeper understanding of them.

:::tip Homepage specifics
There are some specifics for the "home" page component of your project. Check out the [homepage specifics](#homepage-specifics) below for details.

For clarity, the term "page component" here is _not_ to be confused with Next.js' `<Page>` component. This refers to the default exports of JavaScript modules within the `/src/pages/` directory.
:::

## A basic page component

Here's an example `index.js` file for a page component. We'll break it down in the following sections.

```jsx
import { setupPaths, setupProps } from "../../../utils/page-setup";
import PageProvider from "../../../context/page-context";
import useLocale from "../../../hooks/use-locale";

const LOCALE_FOLDER = "about";

const AboutPage = ({}) => {
  const { page, globals } = useLocale(LOCALE_FOLDER);

  return (
    <PageProvider page={LOCALE_FOLDER}>
      <header>
        <h1>{page.header.title}</h1>
        <p>{page.header.body}</p>
      </header>

      <main></main>
    </PageProvider>
  );
};

export const getStaticPaths = () => setupPaths(LOCALE_FOLDER);
export const getStaticProps = async (ctx) => setupProps(ctx, LOCALE_FOLDER);

export default AboutPage;
```

As you can see, the component itself must be the default export of the JavaScript module. Let's break some of these pieces down so we can understand what we're looking at.

### The `LOCALE_FOLDER` constant

The value bound to this constant must match the directory path of your page's `locales` folder. For example, if your homepage locale content lives in `/src/locales/home/`, then your `LOCALE_FOLDER` value must be `"home"`. Likewise, if a nested page's content lives at `/src/locales/work/advertising/`, then your `LOCALE_FOLDER` value must be `"work/advertising"`.

The `LOCALE_FOLDER` is used in many places within a top-level page component, as you can see above.

### `setupPaths` and `setupProps`

These two functions are wrappers around Next.js' [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths) and [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props), respectively. These functions are abstracted away in Corgi so that you don't have to be _as_ concerned with the relatively complex setup of a page. Both of these functions must be imported into the page component, and subsequently exported as `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`; passing in the [`LOCALE_FOLDER`](#the-locale_folder-constant) constant to each.

### The `useLocale` hook

The `useLocale` hook is explained in detail in the [useLocale hook documentation](../localization/use-locale-hook). What's relevant here, is that when setting up a top-level page component, you _must_ pass the `LOCALE_FOLDER` string to the hook. Essentially, this acts as an initializer for the hook. Subsequent uses of the hook in other components do not require this step.

### The `<PageProvider>` component

The PageProvider component is a wrapper around all page content. It expects a `page` prop, set to the string bound to `LOCALE_FOLDER`. This allows Corgi to maintain a cache of sorts, of the page-level content, which is useful when creating page transition animations. Rather than instantly changing the `page` locale data during a page transition of, say, 500 miliseconds, the PageProvider knows to _not_ change the locale data to that of the incoming page until the transition is complete.

## Homepage specifics

One of Corgi's localization opinions is that it gives users of the _default_ locale a nice, locale-free URL. For example, if your default locale is United States English (`"en-us"`), the homepage of your project will live at `your-project.com`, as opposed to `your-project.com/en-us`.

Because the "home" page component must live both at the project root _and_ the dynamic [locale] root, we must abstract the actual homepage content away, into its own component that can be shared across both of these root (`index.js`) files. By default, Corgi sets this content up within the `/src/components/home-page-contents/home-page-contents.js` file. Consequently, all your homepage content must be built-out from within this component, rather than the page two homepage `index.js` components themselves.
