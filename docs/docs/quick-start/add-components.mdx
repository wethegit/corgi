# Components

Components typically live in the `/src/components` directory. This is not a requirement, but it is recommended for consistency's sake, as the corgi CLI creates components here.

## Creating a component

The easiest way to create new components is by using the [**corgi CLI**](../corgi-cli/commands/component):

```sh
npx @wethegit/corgi@latest component MyButton
```

This will scaffold the component file itself, along with an SCSS module file and an index file.
