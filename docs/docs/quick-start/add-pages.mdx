# Add pages

Pages live within the `/src/pages/[locale]` directory. `[locale]` is a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), which—when compiled—gets swapped out with the appropriate locale string in the URL ("en-US", "fr-CA", "pt-BR", etc.)

By default, an index page ("home page") and a sub-page will be created for you within the project. The home page, specifically, behaves slightly differently than sub-pages, so we'll outline each below.

## Home page

Your homepage layout lives in `/src/components/home-page-contents`. Any content on the homepage must be built within this component.

## Sub-pages

All sub-pages live within the `/src/pages/[locale]/<sub-page-name>` directory, and expect an index.jsx file as their source. (`<sub-page-name>` should be replaced with the name of your page, so `/src/pages/[locale]/about`, for example).

## Creating new pages

The easiest way to create new pages is by using the [**corgi CLI**](../corgi-cli/commands/page):

```sh
npx @wethegit/corgi page MySubPage
```

This will scaffold all the necessary files for authoring a new page: the page component itself, an SCSS module file, and all the appropriate locale data files.
