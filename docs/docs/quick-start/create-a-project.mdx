# Create a project

The easiest way to set up a new project is via the [**corgi CLI**](../category/corgi-cli). This page walks through that process at a high level.

To create a new project, run the folling in the command line:

```sh
npx @wethegit/corgi@latest project my-web-app
```

When prompted to enter a template URL, just press enter to skip the step for now. For more information on this step, check out the custom [corgi templates](../corgi-cli/commands/project#templates) documentation.

Once complete, navigate to your new project directory and install all dependencies:

```bash
cd my-web-app
```

```bash
npm install
```

ðŸŽ‰ **That's it! You're ready to start building your web app.**

:::caution Node.JS & NVM
corgi requires **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16 or greater**. If you use `nvm`, run the following before installing dependencies:

```bash
nvm use
```
