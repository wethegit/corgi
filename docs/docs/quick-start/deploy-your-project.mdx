# Build for production

corgi requires Node.js version 16 or greater. If you use nvm, run the following before installing dependencies if you have not done so already:

```bash
nvm use
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `out` folder. Upload the contents of this directory to your static file server of choice.

If you would like to test the build output locally (before deploying), run:
```bash
npm start
```
