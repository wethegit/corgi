# Global Styles

By default, corgi contains a collection of global styles, which are seperated into **four direcories**. These consist of generic resets, CSS custom properties, SASS helper functions, and CSS utility classes. These pre-defined global styles provide you with a foundation to build upon, and many of them are intended to be edited to fit your project's needs.

All global styles are imported at the App level, within `/src/pages/_app.js`. Any external stylesheets must be added here as well (third-party package css files, for example).  

```jsx title=/src/pages/_app.jsx
...
import "../styles/globals.scss";

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  ...
```

Most of these global styles, settings, and helpers are documented within their respective files, so you're encouraged to skim through them to understand the details of each. That said, each of the broad categories is explained below.

## Base

`/src/styles/base/`

The **base** directory is reserved for resets and generic styling, such as typography and spacing. Out-of-the-box, the noteworthy files inside `base` are; `typography.scss` and `resets.scss`. Resets help to define some cross-browser standards for HTML elements in your project.

## Helpers

`/src/styles/helpers/`

The **helpers** directory contains a selection of globally available SASS functions and mixins. These include helpers for easily creating _accessible_ CSS animations and transitions, setting `rem`-based font sizes from pixel values (presumably pulled from design files), and more.

## Utility classes

`/src/styles/utility-classes/`

The **utility-classes** directory houses a variety of useful CSS class names. These range from classes used for adding spacing, to showing/hiding content at certain breakpoints.

## Settings

`/src/styles/settings/`

Lastly, the **settings** directory. This is home to all global settings, such as colors, breakpoints, animations, column/gutter sizes, etc. Many of these settings are intended to be changed on a per project basis. It is here where you can define your flex-based layout system (presumably based on a design file).
