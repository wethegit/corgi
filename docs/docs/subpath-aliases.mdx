# Subpath aliases

By default, corgi sets up a few subpath aliases to help you manage your imports. This becomes especially useful when importing modules from within deeply-nested components or pages.  

The following aliases are available:  


| alias               | location       |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| `@local/components` | src/components |
| `@local/context`    | src/context    |
| `@local/hooks`      | src/hooks      |
| `@local/utils`      | src/utils      |
| `@local/styles`     | src/styles     |

## Usage

### JavaScript imports
```jsx title=src/pages/[locale]/about/index.jsx
import { Button } from "@local/components"
import { useBreakpoints } from "@local/hooks"
```

:::info Component indexing
Notice the above Button component is imported from `"@local/components"`. This assumes that you are exporting your Button component from `/src/components/index.jsx`. Otherwise, you still need to write the path to your component (i.e. `@local/components/button/button`).
:::

### SCSS imports
```scss title=src/components/your-component/your-component.module.scss
@use "@local/styles/helpers/helpers-animation" as *;
@use "@local/styles/helpers/helpers-math" as *;
```
